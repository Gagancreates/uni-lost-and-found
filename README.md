# PESU Lost and Found Platform

A full-stack web application for PESU students to post and find lost or found items. Built with Next.js, Express, MongoDB, and Cloudinary.
## Why did I build this?


I decided to build this lost and found website for my college as I saw a lot of people losing things and posting it on whatsapp groups, which were inefficient, so I thought there was a better way to solve this problem and yeah it lead me to build this website out.
